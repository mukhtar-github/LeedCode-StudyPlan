# Data Structure II

## Array

### 136. Single Number

Given a *non-empty* array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
* -3 x 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 x 10^4
* Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

#### Answer 1

```javascript
var singleNumber = function(nums) {
    let single = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        single ^= num
    }
    return single
};


//Your input
[2,2,1]
//Output
1
//Expected
1
```

### 169. Majority Element

Given an array *nums* of size *n*, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than *⌊n / 2⌋* times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]

Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

Output: 2

Constraints:

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
* -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

#### Answer 2

```javascript
var majorityElement = function(nums) {
    const criterion = nums.length / 2 >> 0
    const countMap = new Map()
    for (const num of nums) {
        const curNum = (countMap.get(num) ?? 0) + 1
        if (curNum > criterion)
            return num
        countMap.set(num, curNum)
    }
};

//Your input
[3,2,3]
//Output
3
//Expected
3
```

### 15. 3Sum

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]

Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

Example 2:

Input: nums = []

Output: []

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]

Output: []

Constraints:

* 0 <= nums.length <= 3000
* -105 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

#### Answer 3

```javascript
var threeSum = function(nums) {
    var res = [];
    if(!nums || !nums.length) return res;

    nums = nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    for(let i=0; i<nums.length - 2; i++){
        while(nums[i-1] === nums[i]) i++;
        
        let j=i+1, k=nums.length-1;
        while(j<k){
            let sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k];
            if(sum === 0){
                res.push([nums[i],nums[j],nums[k]]);
                while (nums[j] === nums[j + 1]) j++;
                while (nums[k] === nums[k-1]) k--;
            }
            //searching for -nums[i]
            if(sum > 0){
                k--;
            }else{
                j++;
            }            
        }
    }
    return res;
};

//Your input
[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
//Output
[[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
//Expected
[[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

### 75. Sort Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]

Output: [0,1,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]

Output: [0]

Example 4:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: [1]

Constraints:

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 300
* nums[i] is 0, 1, or 2.

Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

#### Answer 4

```javascript
var sortColors = function(nums) {
    let low= 0, high= nums.length- 1, mid= 0, temp= 0;
    
    while(mid <= high) {
        if(nums[mid] === 0) {
            // swap mid and low pointers values
            temp= nums[low];
            nums[low] = nums[mid];
            nums[mid]= temp;
            
            low++;
            mid++;
        } else if(nums[mid] === 2) {
            // swap mid and high pointers values
            temp= nums[high];
            nums[high]= nums[mid];
            nums[mid]= temp;
            
            high--;
        } else {
            mid++
        }
    }
    
    return nums;
};

//Your input
[2,0,2,1,1,0]
//Output
[0,0,1,1,2,2]
//Expected
[0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

### 56. Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]

Output: [[1,5]]

Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Constraints:

* 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
* intervals[i].length == 2
* 0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4

#### Answer 5

```javascript
var merge = function(intervals) {
    
    if(intervals.length <2){
        return intervals;
    }
    
    // sort intervals    
    const sortedIntervals = intervals.sort((a,b) => {
        return a[0]-b[0];
    });
    
    
    let stack = [];
    stack.push(sortedIntervals[0]);
    
    for(let i=1;i<sortedIntervals.length;i++){
        let currStartTime = sortedIntervals[i][0];
        let currEndTime = sortedIntervals[i][1];
        let prevStartTime = stack[stack.length-1][0];
        let prevEndTime = stack[stack.length-1][1];
        
        if(currStartTime <= prevEndTime){
            stack[stack.length-1] = [Math.min(currStartTime,prevStartTime),Math.max(prevEndTime,currEndTime)];
        }
        else {
            stack.push(sortedIntervals[i]);
        }
    }
    return stack;
};

//Your input
[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
//Output
[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
//Expected
[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```

### 706. Design HashMap

Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement the MyHashMap class:

MyHashMap() initializes the object with an empty map.
void put(int key, int value) inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists in the map, update the corresponding value.
int get(int key) returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
void remove(key) removes the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key.

Example 1:

Input

["MyHashMap", "put", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "remove", "get"]

[[], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3], [2, 1], [2], [2], [2]]

Output

[null, null, null, 1, -1, null, 1, null, -1]

Explanation

MyHashMap myHashMap = new MyHashMap();

myHashMap.put(1, 1); // The map is now [[1,1]]

myHashMap.put(2, 2); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]

myHashMap.get(1);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]

myHashMap.get(3);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]

myHashMap.put(2, 1); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]] (i.e., update the existing value)

myHashMap.get(2);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]]

myHashMap.remove(2); // remove the mapping for 2, The map is now [[1,1]]

myHashMap.get(2);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1]]

Constraints:

* 0 <= key, value <= 10^6
* At most 10^4 calls will be made to put, get, and remove.

#### Answer 6

```javascript
/*

var MyHashMap = function() {
    
};

/** 
 * @param {number} key

        let h = this.hash(key)
        let node = new ListNode(key, val, this.data[h])
        this.data[h] = node
    }
    get(key) {
        let h = this.hash(key), node = this.data[h]

            if (node.key === key) return node.val
        return -1
    }
    remove(key) {
        let h = this.hash(key), node = this.data[h]
        if (!node) return
        if (node.key === key) this.data[h] = node.next
        else for (; node.next; node = node.next)
            if (node.next.key === key) {
                node.next = node.next.next
                return
            }
    }
};

//Your input
["MyHashMap","put","put","get","get","put","get","remove","get"]
[[],[1,1],[2,2],[1],[3],[2,1],[2],[2],[2]]
//Output
[null,null,null,1,-1,null,1,null,-1]
//Expected
[null,null,null,1,-1,null,1,null,-1]
```

### 119. Pascal's Triangle II

#### Answer 7

Given an integer *rowIndex*, return the *rowIndex^th* (*0-indexed*) row of the *Pascal's triangle*.

In *Pascal's triangle*, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

![PascalTriangleAnimated2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif)

Example 1:

Input: rowIndex = 3

Output: [1,3,3,1]

Example 2:

Input: rowIndex = 0

Output: [1]

Example 3:

Input: rowIndex = 1

Output: [1,1]

Constraints:

* 0 <= rowIndex <= 33

Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?

The other top answers are all mostly of O(N^2) time complexity. So, I thought to include my solution here which is Linear in time.

As you see you can get any element of Pascal's Triangle in O(N) time and constant space complexity.
for first row first column we have 1C1
for second row first column we have 2C1
for second row second column we have 2C2
..... and so on
Therefore we can infer, for ith row and jth column we have the number iCj

And calculating this is pretty easy just in N time (factorial basically).

==> nCr = n*(n-1)*(n-2)...(r terms) / 1*2*..........*(r-2)*(r-1)*r

Now the question asks us to find the complete row.
If we calculate all the elements in this manner it would be quadratic in time. But, since its formula is pretty sleek, we proceed as follows:

suppose we have nCr and we have to find nC(r+1), like 5C3 and 5C4
==> 5C3 = 5*4*3 / 1*2*3

to get the next term we multiply numerator with its next term and denominator with its next term. As,
==> 5C4 = 5*4*3*2 / 1*2*3*4

We are following this simple maths logic to get the complete row in O(N) time.

Note:- We didnt actually need the variable temp. But the test cases are such that multiplying in one case exceeds the int range, and since we cannot change return type we have to take the long data type variable as temporary.

```javascript
// rowIndex = r

var getRow = function(r) {
    var ans = new Array(r+1)
    ans[0]=ans[r]=1
    for(i=1,up=r;i<r;i++,up--)
        ans[i] = ans[i-1]*up/i
    return ans
};
    

//Your input
3
//Output
[1,3,3,1]
//Expected
[1,3,3,1]
```

### 48. Rotate Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:

![mat1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat1.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

Example 2:

![mat2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat2.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]

Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]

Example 3:

Input: matrix = [[1]]

Output: [[1]]

Example 4:

Input: matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]

Output: [[3,1],[4,2]]

Constraints:

* matrix.length == n
* matrix[i].length == n
* 1 <= n <= 20
* -1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000

#### Answer 8

The idea behind this relies on some math but I'll try my best with an ELI5 answer.

TLDR: Solve this by row reversing then transposing the matrix or transpose the matrix then reverse the columns

When you perform a 90 degree rotation the "diagonal" swaps directions.

[(X), 2, 3]          [7, 4, (X)]

[4, (X), 6]    =>    [8, (X), 2]     90 degree rotation

[7, 8, (X)]          [(X), 6, 3]

So to swap the diagonal you must either reverse by row or by column. If you imagine the matrix as a physical paper, swapping the row or column would be like flipping the paper over. So the diagonal is now swapped but the paper is now flipped on its back. So to flip the paper back to the proper face, you must perform a transpose.

To over simplify why you must transpose is because in 2D, a matrix transpose is like a form of geometric translation which is what a rotation is; however, a transpose is not enough to rotate a matrix as the values do not map to the correct positions. Reversing the row or column simply "corrects" the rotation.

[(X), 2, 3]          [7, 8, (X)]

[4, (X), 6]    =>    [4, (X), 6]     Reverse the rows to swap "diagonal" direction

[7, 8, (X)]          [(X), 2, 3]

[(X), 8, 9]          [7, 4, 1]

[4, (X), 6]    =>    [8, 5, 2]  Transposing along the diagonal will complete the rotation (assuming you row reversed first)

[1, 2, (X)]          [9, 6, 3]

Finally, you must know that: MATRIX MULTIPLICATION IS NOT COMMUTATIVE!

Order matters meaning,

(row reverse) x (transpose) =/= (transpose) x (row reverse)

But FYI, these two operations are the same

(row reverse) x (transpose) == (transpose) x (column reverse)

So you can solve this by first reversing rows then transposing or transposing then reverse columns. You can choose however you like.

```javascript
var rotate = function(matrix) {
    let length = matrix.length
    
    matrix.reverse()
    
    // transpose
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            let temp = matrix[i][j]
            matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i]
            matrix[j][i] = temp
        }
    }
    
    return matrix
};
    

//Your input
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
//Output
[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
//Expected
[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        board[i] = Array(n).fill(0)
    }
    for (i = 1; i <= n * n; i++) {
        board[row][col] = i
        let nRow = row + dr[dir % 4],
            nCol = col + dc[dir % 4]
        if (nRow >= 0 && nRow < n && nCol >= 0 && nCol < n && board[nRow] && board[nRow][nCol] == 0) {
            row = nRow
            col = nCol
        } else {
            dir++
            row += dr[dir % 4]
            col += dc[dir % 4]
        }
    }
    return board

Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]

Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

Constraints:

* 1 <= intervals.length <= 10<sub>5</sub>
* intervals[i].length == 2
* -5 * 10<sup>4</sup> <= start<sub>i</sub> < end<sub>i</sub> <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>

#### Answer 11

```javascript
var eraseOverlapIntervals = function(intervals) {
    // sort by earliest finish time
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    let prev = intervals[0], remove = 0;
    
    for(let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if(intervals[i][0] < prev[1]) remove++;
        else prev = intervals[i];
    }
    return remove;
};



/*
The idea is to sort the intervals by their start times and then traverse the array from behind. If the end time at interval[i-1] is greater than the start time at interval[i] we have found overlap. So we move to check interval[i] with interval[i-2] endtime and so on till we get to an interval j where the there is no overlap. Then we let i = j.

Reasoning
We traverse from the right of the list becuase whenever we meet an interval at j which doesn't overlap with our current interval i, there can be no more overlaping intervals beyond j and the overlaps between i and j is minimum.
*/
var eraseOverlapIntervals = function(intervals) {
    intervals.sort((a,b) => a[0]-b[0])
    let n = intervals.length
    let res = 0
    let i = n-1
    while(i>0){
        let j = i-1
        while(j>=0 && intervals[j][1] > intervals[i][0]){
            res++
            j--
        }
        i = j
    }
    return res
};


var eraseOverlapIntervals = function(intervals) {
    intervals.sort((a,b)=>{
        return a[1] - b[1]
    })
    let count = 0;
    let prev = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[prev][1]) {
            count++;
        } else {
            prev = i;
        }
    }
    return count;
};

### 334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence

Given an integer array *nums*, return *true* if there exists a triple of indices *(i, j, k)* such that *i < j < k* and *nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]*. If no such indices exists, return *false*.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: true

Explanation: Any triplet where i < j < k is valid.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,4,3,2,1]

Output: false

Explanation: No triplet exists.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,1,5,0,4,6]

Output: true

Explanation: The triplet (3, 4, 5) is valid because nums[3] == 0 < nums[4] == 4 < nums[5] == 6.

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10<sup>5</sup>
* -2<sup>31</sup> <= nums[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

Follow up: Could you implement a solution that runs in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity?

#### Answer 12

```javascript
/*
Approach Summary:
Constraints
We are heavily constrained by O(1), O(n) space & time complexities, which means:

No trees or arrays
No nesting loops (unless the nested loop is constant size)
A hint in the description

There's a hint in the formal function definition:

Return true if there exists i, j, k
such that arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 else return false.
This can be reconfigured as arr[i] (currentNumber) > arr[j] (secondNumber) > arr[k] (firstNumber). Since we are already tracking currentNumber on each iteration, we only need to track two other numbers to get our (potential) triplet:

var increasingTriplet = function(nums) {
  let firstNumber = Infinity;
  let secondNumber = Infinity;
  
  for (let currentNumber of nums) {
We can start at Infinity for the two minimum numbers, since we'll want to grab the first two number we come accross.

Success Condition
We should be able to reach a state where currentNumber (set as arr[i] in our algorithm) is greater than the first and second-most minimum numbers.

if (currentNumber > secondNumber && currentNumber > firstNumber) {
  return true;
}
That is, if at any point in the loop, we find a number that is greater than our two stored numbers, then we automatically have a valid triplet. Thus, we can return true.

Tracking Minimum Numbers
We need to track two other numbers to make a subsequence with currentNumber.

if (currentNumber > firstNumber) {
  secondNumber = currentNumber;
} else {
  firstNumber = currentNumber;
}
Basically, this conditional ensures that we always have the lowest number in the array stored as firstNumber. Then, each time we encounter a number that's larger than firstNumber, we store that number and continue.

The reason this works is that if we ever find another number that's larger than secondNumber, then we have our triplet and our first conditional triggers and returns true for us.

By the end of all this, if we never find that third (or second!) increasing number, then it doesn't exist in our list and we return false.
*/

var increasingTriplet = function(nums) {
  let firstNumber = Infinity;
  let secondNumber = Infinity;
  
  for (let currentNumber of nums) {
    if (currentNumber > secondNumber && currentNumber > firstNumber) {
      return true;
    }
    if (currentNumber > firstNumber) {
      secondNumber = currentNumber;
    } else {
      firstNumber = currentNumber;
    }
  }
  return false;
};

/*
This solution has already been posted by others, but I think it's easier to understand with some subtle changes. This particular logic greatly benefits from clear naming.

Start min off at the first element so that secondMinUpdatedAfterMin is bigger, unlike the case where we start at Infinity. This makes it clear that min is the minimum thus far, and more importantly it's obvious that we are using the the two variables as our respective i and j elements since min < secondMinUpdatedAfterMin.

Most importantly secondMinUpdatedAfterMin is a better name than bigger or even secondMin because these do not convey when the variable is updated. A name like secondMin is presumed to be the global second minimum so far, which is definitely not the case. For example, nums = [12,8,11,4,6,5,1,9,2,10] stores the following on each iteration:

                          │    │    │    │  i │    │  j │    │  k │    │
──────────────────────────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────
 nums                     │ 12 │  8 │ 11 │  4 │  6 │  5 │  1 │  9 │  2 │ 10
──────────────────────────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────
 min                      │ 12 │  8 │  8 │  4 │  4 │  4 │  1 │  1 │  - │  -
──────────────────────────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────
 secondMinUpdatedAfterMin │  ∞ │  ∞ │ 11 │ 11 │  6 │  5 │  5 │  5 │  - │  -
The 4th time around secondMinUpdatedAfterMin is 11 but the global second minimum so far is 8 which is the impression given by an ambiguous naming. The shorter secondMinAfterMin is better as well, but it is also ambiguous in that after isn't true in every sense--in the aforementioned iteration 11 comes before 4 in nums.
*/
var increasingTriplet = function(nums) {
    let min = nums[0];
    let secondMinUpdatedAfterMin = Infinity;
    for (let val of nums) {
        if (val <= min) {
            min = val;
        } else if (val <= secondMinUpdatedAfterMin) {
            secondMinUpdatedAfterMin = val;
        } else {  // min < secondMinUpdatedAfterMin < val
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
};

/*
The Idea
1. Keep track of the minimum for the 1st number(min1) and the 2nd number(min2)

var increasingTriplet = function(nums) {

### 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array *nums*, return an array *answer* such that *answer[i]* is equal to the product of all the elements of *nums* except *nums[i]*.

The product of any prefix or suffix of *nums* is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in *O(n)* time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]

Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

Constraints:

* 2 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
* The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

#### Answer 13

```javascript
var productExceptSelf = function (nums) {

    let size = nums.length;
    const multiplied = new Array(size).fill(1);

    let product = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        product *= nums[i - 1];
        multiplied[i] = product;
    }

    product = 1;
    for (let i = size - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        product *= nums[i + 1];
        multiplied[i] *= product;
    }

    return multiplied;
};


var productExceptSelf = function(nums) {
    let left = []
    let right = []
    let result = []

    left[0] = 1;
    for(let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        left[i] = left[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
    }

    right[nums.length - 1] = 1;
    for(let i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        right[i] = right[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
    }

    for(let i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
        result[i] = left[i] * right[i];
    }
    return result;
};


//Your input
[1,2,3,4]
//Output
[24,12,8,6]
//Expected
[24,12,8,6]
```

### 560. Subarray Sum Equals K

Given an array of integers *nums* and an integer *k*, return the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to *k*.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2

Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3

Output: 2

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-10<sup>7</sup> <= k <= 10<sup>7</sup>

#### Answer 14

The idea - Hash Map

The key idea of how we can solve this problem in O(N) time using hashmap is to understand how we can correctly use the information from 1 iteration of calculating sums.

Something to understand first is, when Sum_i = #0 + #1 + #2 .... + #i = 6, and Sum_k #0 + #1 + #2 ... + #k = 10, its pretty obvious that between #i to #k is equal to 4, and we can write that mathmatically to Sum_k - Sum_i = Sumi_to_k
So In order to find k we are basically trying to find a pair of Sum_i and Sum_k such that Sum_k - Sum_i = k. Since we are only iterating the array once and calculating the sum from left to right accumatively, we can keep a record of all the sums up to index i, that is Sum0, Sum1...Sumi. For each new sum, we can check if there is a previous Sum such that Sum_current - Sum_prev = k. In order to find what is the "old_index", we can just change the formula to Sum_curren - k = Sum_old and look up from our record to see if we find a matching pair. If we did, bingo, that means we found a valid subarray.

![image_1574125964](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/aminick/image_1574125964.png)

```javascript
// Hash Map
var subarraySumHashMap = function(nums, k) {
    let map = new Map();
    let sum = 0;
    let count = 0;
    map.set(0,1);
    for (let i=0;i<nums.length;i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
        if (map.has(sum-k)) count += map.get(sum-k);
        if (map.has(sum)) map.set(sum, map.get(sum)+1);
        else map.set(sum, 1);
    }
    return count;
};

## String

### 415. Add Strings

Given two non-negative integers, *num1 and num2* represented as string, return the sum of *num1 and num2* as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

Example 1:

Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"

Output: "134"

Example 2:

Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"

Output: "533"

Example 3:

Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"

Output: "0"

Constraints:

* 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
* num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

#### Answer 15

```javascript
/*
1. We will convert both strings into arrays and iterate through both numbers from the back.
2. At each index, we add the digits of both arrays and compute properly considering `carry` and
record the correct digit to a result array at correct index (we'll keep track of this).
3. Given numbers can have different lengths so if we reached the start of either number, we consider its digit
as zero so we can traverse to the end of both numbers.
4. After iteration is done, we check if carry is still there. If so, we add it to the front of our result array.
Hence, our result array should have a length of max(num1.length, num2.length) + 1.
*/

var addStrings = function(num1, num2) {
    num1 = num1.split("");
    num2 = num2.split("");
    let res = new Array(Math.max(num1.length, num2.length) + 1);
    let i = num1.length-1, j = num2.length-1, k = res.length - 1;
    let carry = 0, sum = 0;
    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0) {
        sum = (i >= 0 ? Number(num1[i]) : 0) 
            + (j >= 0 ? Number(num2[j]) : 0)
            + carry;
        carry = sum >= 10 ? 1 : 0;
        res[k] = sum % 10;
        i--, j--, k--;
    }
    if (carry > 0) {
        res[k] = carry;
    }
    return res.join("");
    // T.C: O(M + N), M = length of num1, N = length of num2
    // S.C: O(M + N)
};


var addStrings = function(num1, num2) {
    if(num1.length>num2.length) num2 = num2.padStart(num1.length,"0");
    else num1 = num1.padStart(num2.length,"0");
    var result = new Array(num1.length+1).fill(0);
    for(i=result.length-1, j=num1.length-1 ;j>=0 ;i--, j--){
        k = parseInt(num1[j])+parseInt(num2[j])+parseInt(result[i]);
        if(k>=10) result[i-1]=1, k%=10;  
        result[i]=k;
    }
    if(result[0]===0) result.shift();
    return result.join("");
};

//Your input
"11"
"123"
//Output
"134"
//Expected
"134"
```

### 409. Longest Palindrome

Given a string *s* which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the *longest palindrome* that can be built with those letters.

Letters are *case sensitive*, for example, *"Aa"* is not considered a palindrome here.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abccccdd"

Output: 7

Explanation:

One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a"

Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: s = "bb"

Output: 2

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 2000
* s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.

#### Answer 16

```javascript
var longestPalindrome = function(s) {
    let map = {};
    for(let i of s){
        map[i] = map[i]? map[i]+1: 1;
    }
    let count = 0;
    let flag = 0;
    for(let i in map){
        if(map[i]%2 == 0) count += map[i];
        else {
            count += map[i] -1;
            flag = 1;
        }
    }
    return count+flag;
};


var longestPalindrome = function(s) {
    const set = new Set();
    let count = 0;
    
    for (const char of s) {
        if (set.has(char)) {
            count += 2;
            set.delete(char);
        } 
        else {
            set.add(char);
        }
    }

    return count + (set.size > 0 ? 1 : 0);
};

//Your input
"abccccdd"
//Output
7
//Expected
7
```

### 290. Word Pattern

Given a *pattern* and a string *s*, find if *s* follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in *pattern* and a non-empty word in *s*.

Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: false

Example 4:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog dog dog dog"

Output: false

Constraints:

* 1 <= pattern.length <= 300
* pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
* 1 <= s.length <= 3000
* s contains only lower-case English letters and spaces ' '.
* s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
* All the words in s are separated by a single space.

#### Answer 17

```javascript
var wordPattern = function(pattern, s) {
    let patterVisisted = new Set();
    let SwordsMap = new Map();
    let tokens = s.split(' ');
    if(tokens.length != pattern.length) return false;
    for(let g=0; g<pattern.length; g++){
        let c = pattern[g];
        if( patterVisisted.has(c) ){
            if(SwordsMap.get(tokens[g]) != c) return false;
        }
        else {
            if(SwordsMap.has(tokens[g])) return false;
            patterVisisted.add(c);
            SwordsMap.set(tokens[g], c);
        }
    }
    
    return true;
    
};


var wordPattern = function(pattern, str) {
    const words = str.split(/\s+/);
    const map = new Map();
    
    if(words.length !== pattern.length) return false;
    if(new Set(words).size !== new Set(pattern).size) return false;
    
    for(let i = 0; i < pattern.length; i++) {
        if(map.has(pattern[i]) && 
           map.get(pattern[i]) !== words[i]) return false;
        map.set(pattern[i], words[i]);
    }
    return true;
};


//Your input
"abba"
"dog cat cat dog"
//Output
true
//Expected
true
```

### 763. Partition Labels

You are given a string *s*. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"

Output: [9,7,8]

Explanation:

The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
Example 2:

Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"

Output: [10]

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 500
* s consists of lowercase English letters.

#### Answer 18

```javascript
/*
This is basically the same as other JS solutions out there, but I broke out values into variables and gave everything semantic names for clarity.

Iterate through the string to find the last index of each character.
Create a variable start, which will be the start index (the smaller one) of a partition. Start should start at zero, and only change after a new partition has been created.
Create a variable end, which will be the end index (the larger one) of a partition. End should start at zero, and should change depending on what character is being inspected.
Iterate through the string. If the character at string[i] has an last index greater than the current end, update end to lastSeenIndices[char].
If i === end, then we have found a partition, and need to store it in our partitions array. Update start, and continue iterating.
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)—beacuse we will never have more keys in our lastSeenIndices then there are single characters in whatever alphabet(s) we're using, this is constant space. If our input string were 10,000,000 characters long and we only had lowercase English letters, we would never have more than 26 keys.
*/

const partitionLabels = string => {
    const lastSeenIndices = {};
    
    for (let i = string.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const char = string[i];

    const partitions = [];
    let start = 0;
    let end = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
        const char = string[i];
        const lastCharIdx = lastSeenIndices[char];
        
        if (lastCharIdx > end) end = lastCharIdx;
        
        if (i === end) {
            const partition = end - start + 1;
            partitions.push(partition);
            start = i + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return partitions;
};


var partitionLabels = function(s) {
    let last=-1;
    const res=[];
    let left=0;
    for(let i=0;i<s.length;i++){
        last=Math.max(s.lastIndexOf(s[i]),last)
        if(i===last){
            res.push(i-left+1);
            left=i+1
        }
    }
    return res;
};


//Your input
"ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
//Output
[9,7,8]
//Expected
[9,7,8]
```

### 49. Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings *strs*, group *the anagrams* together. You can return the answer in any order.

An *Anagram* is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]

Output: [[""]]

Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]

Output: [["a"]]

Constraints:

### 43. Multiply Strings

Given two non-negative integers *num1 and num2* represented as strings, return the product of *num1 and num2*, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

Example 1:

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"

Output: "6"

Example 2:

Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"

Output: "56088"

Constraints:

* 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200
* num1 and num2 consist of digits only.
* Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

#### Answer 20

Start from right to left, perform multiplication on every pair of digits, and add them together. Let's draw the process! From the following draft, we can immediately conclude:

num1[i] * num2[j] will be placed at indices [i + j, i + j + 1]

![image_1591345827](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/murzabulatov/image_1591345827.png)

```javascript
var multiply = function(num1, num2) {
    if (num1 === '0' || num2 === '0') return '0'
    
    const m = num1.length, n = num2.length, res = new Array(m+n).fill(0)
    
    for (let i=m-1; i>=0; i--) {
        for (let j=n-1; j>=0; j--) {
            const p1=i+j, p2=i+j+1
            let sum = res[p2] + Number(num1[i]) * Number(num2[j])
            res[p2] = sum%10
            res[p1] += Math.floor(sum/10)
        }
    }
    if (res[0] === 0) res.shift()
    return res.join('')
    
};


//Your input
"2"
"3"
//Output
"6"
//Expected
"6"
```

### 187. Repeated DNA Sequences

The *DNA sequence* is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

* For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a *DNA sequence*.

When studying *DNA*, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the *DNA*.

Given a string *s* that represents a *DNA sequence*, return all the *10-letter-long* sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a *DNA* molecule. You may return the answer in *any order*.

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]

Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"

Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'

#### Answer 21

```javascript
var findRepeatedDnaSequences = function(s) {
    let curr = s.slice(0, 10);
    const seen = new Set([curr]);
    const res = new Set();
    
    for(let i = 10; i < s.length; i++) {
        curr = curr.slice(1) + s[i];
        if(seen.has(curr)) res.add(curr);
        seen.add(curr);
    }
    return [...res];
};


//Your input
"AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
//Output
["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
//Expected
["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
```

### 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string *s*, return the longest palindromic substring in *s*.

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"

Output: "bab"

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"

Output: "bb"

Example 3:

Input: s = "a"

Output: "a"

Example 4:

Input: s = "ac"

Output: "a"

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consist of only digits and English letters.

#### Answer 22

```javascript
var longestPalindrome = function(s) {
    let longest = '';
    
    const GetLongestPalindrome = (l,r) => {
        while(l >=0 && r< s.length && s[l] === s[r]){
            if(r-l+1 > longest.length){
                longest = s.slice(l, r+1);
            }
            l--;
            r++;
        }
    }
    
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
        GetLongestPalindrome(i,i);
        GetLongestPalindrome(i,i+1);
    }
    return longest;
};


//Your input
"babad"
//Output
"bab"
//Expected
"bab"
```

## Linked List

### 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two *non-empty* linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in *reverse order*, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

![addtwonumber1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]

Output: [7,0,8]

Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]

Output: [0]

Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]

Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 9
* It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

#### Answer 23

```javascript
var addTwoNumbers = function(l1, l2) {
    let sum = new ListNode(0), curDigit = 0, carry = 0, head = sum;
    while (l1 || l2 || carry > 0){
        let val1 = l1? l1.val:0, val2 = l2? l2.val:0; // storing values we are working with for this iteration. 
        curDigit = (val1 + val2 + carry)%10;
        carry = Math.floor((val1 + val2 +carry)/10)
        l1 = l1? l1.next: l1; // increment l1 and l2 to the next node, making sure not accessing property of null
        l2 = l2? l2.next: l2;
        let node = new ListNode(curDigit); // create single node in list with curDigit and append to head of linked list
        head.next = node;
        head = head.next;
    }
    return sum.next; // we leave the first val out since it is just the head/starting node
};


//Your input
[2,4,3]
[5,6,4]
//Output
[7,0,8]
//Expected
[7,0,8]
```

### 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given the *head* of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return *null*.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the *next* pointer. Internally, *pos* is used to denote the index of the node that tail's *next* pointer is connected to *(0-indexed)*. It is *-1* if there is no cycle. Note that *pos* is not passed as a parameter.

*Do not modify* the linked list.

Example 1:

![circularlinkedlist](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1

Output: tail connects to node index 1

Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

Example 2:

![circularlinkedlist_test2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0

Output: tail connects to node index 0

Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Example 3:

![circularlinkedlist_test3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

Input: head = [1], pos = -1

Output: no cycle

Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Constraints:

* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10<sup>4</sup>].
* -10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

#### Answer 24

```javascript
var detectCycle = function(head) {
    if(!head) return head
    let fast = head
    let slow = head
    
    //detect intersection with fast and slow pointer 
    while(slow){
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next ? fast.next.next : fast.next
        if(!fast || !slow) return null
        if(fast == slow) break
    }
   
   // find offset at which steps from head and intersection meet
    while(head != slow){
        head = head.next
        slow = slow.next
    }
    return head
};


//Your input
[3,2,0,-4]
1
//Output
tail connects to node index 1
//Expected
tail connects to node index 1
```

### 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists *headA* and *headB*, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return *null*.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node *c1*:

![160_statement](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_statement.png)

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

Custom Judge:

The inputs to the *judge* are given as follows (your program is *not* given these inputs):

* intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
* listA - The first linked list.
* listB - The second linked list.
* skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
* skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, *headA and headB* to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be *accepted*.

Example 1:

![160_example_1_1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_1_1.png)

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3

Output: Intersected at '8'

Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

Example 2:

![160_example_2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_2.png)

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1

Output: Intersected at '2'

Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Example 3:

![160_example_3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)

Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2

Output: No intersection

Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

Constraints:

* The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
* The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
* 1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
* 1 <= Node.val <= 105
* 0 <= skipA < m
* 0 <= skipB < n
* intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
* intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.

Follow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?

#### Answer 25

```javascript
/*
dea:
The naive approach here would be to store each node reference in a data structure until we saw the same one twice, but that would take O(N) extra space.

In order to solve this problem with only O(1) extra space, we'll need to find another way to align the two linked lists. More importantly, we need to find a way to line up the ends of the two lists. And the easiest way to do that is to concatenate them in opposite orders, A+B and B+A. This way, the ends of the two original lists will align on the second half of each merged list.

Then we just need to check if at some point the two merged lists are pointing to the same node. In fact, even if the two merged lists don't intersect, the value of a and b will be the same (null) when we come to the end of the merged lists, so we can use that as our exit condition.

We just need to make sure to string headB onto a and vice versa if one (but not both) list ends.
*/
var getIntersectionNode = function(headA, headB) {
    let a = headA, b = headB
    while (a !== b) {
        a = !a ? headB : a.next
        b = !b ? headA : b.next
    }
    return a
};


//Your input
8
[4,1,8,4,5]
[5,6,1,8,4,5]
2
3
//Output
Intersected at '8'
//Expected
Intersected at '8'
```

### 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

Given the *head* of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list *sorted* as well.

Example 1:

![linkedlist1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist1.jpg)

Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]

Output: [1,2,5]

Example 2:

![linkedlist2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist2.jpg)

Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]

Output: [2,3]

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
* The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

#### Answer 26

```javascript
Solution

1. We keep track of prev node and prevPrev node while we iterate through the list.
2. While prev === cur, advance cur until prev != cur; set prevPrev point to cur node so that
the list of duplicate nodes from prev to cur-1 is removed; if prevPrev is null, cur node is the new head
*/
const deleteDuplicates = (head) => {
    const res = new ListNode(-1)
    let last = res
    let dupe = null
    let curr = head
    while (curr) {
        const next = curr.next
        if (!next) {
            if (curr.val !== dupe) {
                last.next = curr
            }
            break
        }
        if (curr.val === next.val || curr.val === dupe) {
            dupe = curr.val
            curr = curr.next
        } else {
            last.next = curr
            last = curr
            curr = curr.next
            last.next = null
        }
    }
    return res.next
};


//Your input
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
//Output
[1,2,5]
//Expected
[1,2,5]
```
